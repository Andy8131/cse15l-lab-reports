![Image](img3/opening-config-file.png)

First, type in 
```
 ~/.ssh/config
 ```
  to open up the config file. If it does not exist, it can be created in vscode.

  Inside the file add this: 
  ```
  Host ieng6
    HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
    User cs15lwi22aiv
  ```

  I get to choose what comes after "Host" on the first line. The HostName has to be thename of the server, and the User has to be my username.

Now, I can log into my ieng6 account with just
```
ssh ieng6
```
